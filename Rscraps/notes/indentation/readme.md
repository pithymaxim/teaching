# Indenting nicely in R #

You should use indentation to help emphasize the structure of your code. Here is an example from a ggplot command.

Note the **two levels of indentation**.

The options that follow a `ggplot()` call are called "layers." The **dashed green line** shows that every distinct layer gets a new line, and it's aligned with all the other layers.

Some layers have multiple lines. Those are also indented and aligned along the **solid red line**. 

This will help make your code clear to readers--most importantly your future self!
