# Place effects in Stata

Many papers in economics are about stable geographic difference in outcomes across places. For an example, check out: [Place-Based Drivers of Mortality: Evidence from Migration](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190825). They show that mortality rates differ a lot across different metropolitan areas in the US, and that some of this appears to be causal because people who move to high-longevity areas tend to live longer.

The core objects of interest in these analyses are "place effects." The simplest possible version of this is to write it out as follows:

$$
Y_{ip} = \Theta_p + e_{it}
$$
